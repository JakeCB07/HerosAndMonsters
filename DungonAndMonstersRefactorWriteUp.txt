Jakes Refactors
1. Stored the stats for the Sorcerer, Warrior, Theif, Skeleton, Ogre, and Gremlin
   in order to eliminate some magic numbers as well as improve readability. 
2. Employed the Strategy Pattern to encapsulate the attack behaviors of
   Heros and Monsters to improve maintainability as well as extendability.
   Also got rid of duplicate code.
3. Employed the Strategy Pattern again to healing behaviors to improve maintainability
   and extendability. This also improved readability and eliminated duplicate code.
4. Deleted code that served no purpose. Main offender being the Comparable interface being 
   implemented for no reason.
5. Deleted extranious comments. If the code is intent revealing, theres no need for all
   these comments.
6. Added a GameManger to clean up the main method as well as encapsulate "game behaviors."
7. Created a Hero and Monster factory that encapsulations DungeonCharacter creation.
8. Updated the outdated Keyboard system to Scanner.
